There's a spot just down the hill with bikes available to rent by the hour. (check the map) Rideshare: Ride Austin ---  We highly recommend using this rideshare service to get around the city.  This is a locally based non-profit that benefits our community, and you would be cooler if you used it-- just sayin' Pedi Cabs: That part about keeping Austin Weird -- we meant it.  You can take you and your crew around in style by pedi cab.  They even offer group rates and brewery/ pub crawls.

The streets are narrow and often you will find cars double-parked while people greet each other or grab a cup of cappuccino from the now famous Mike’s pastry on Hanover St. Things to remember about parking: •	The best place to park without paying is in a visitor’s space  on Hanover Street.    Pay attention to the signs because some are from 8am-6pm and some are 12pm –6pm.  Free parking is limited usually to two hours and is often enforced. The area is very popular with tourists, so it may take time to find free parking. •	Metered parking is usually available all along Commercial Street, which runs perpendicular to Hanover Street.  Bring plenty of quarters. •	For overnight parking, I recommend parking in the Sargent’s Wharf on Commercial Street, right next to Starbucks.

The idea was to take the best things about Denver’s classic neighborhoods – parks, welcoming front porches, architectural diversity and tree-lined streets – and continue those urban patterns into Stapleton. And perhaps the most sustainable idea of them all: a pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use environment with everything you need a short walk or bike ride away.  Two decades later, Stapleton stands as a model for urban redevelopment worldwide.  Buzzing with bike races, farmers markets and concerts in the park, Stapleton now thrives at a grassroots level thanks to residents and business owners each adding their own touch. It has become a place that’s far better than anyone could have planned.|If you aren't renting a car, Lyft and Uber are great ways to explore the city.

Originally annexed as the Town of North Denver, the Berkeley neighborhood has set the stage for some of Denver's most well-known names. Historic giants like Elitch's (Zoological) Gardens, whose original theatre is still located at 38th and Tennyson, helped to create the vibrant cultural landscape unique to the neighborhood and its history. Mary Elitch, the owner of Elitch's Gardens and namesake theatre, had a particular interest in developing the arts and cultural scene in the northwest Denver neighborhood.

You will be welcomed into a beautiful and sunny townhouse surrounded by trees and foliage with a view of the mountains. A gourmet kitchen with every amenity you could want awaits you, as you are greeted with our special homemade delicious guilt free cookies. Everyone is certain that our cookies have to be bad for you because they're so good... but in true LA style, your welcome cookies will have no more calories (and the same nutritional value) as a bowl of oatmeal (and MUCH more fun to eat!). You'll have the whole home to yourself, but if you opt for any of our luxury packages, we will be ve"|"Woodland Hills and Calabasas (the neighboring town) is being called the new ""Beverly Hills"". It's very high end shopping and dining away from the crazy traffic and hassles of the Hollywood scene. The neighborhoods are filled with celebrities who have chosen to live there to get more space and a better quality of life. The air is cleaner. The hiking is SPECTACULAR! (Come visit the original set of the TV Show ""Mash"" as you hike up in the mountains towards Malibu). Many people think they need to be in Hollywood or Beverly Hills to get the ""L.A. experience"", but truly, that experience really just means being stuck in traffic and battling to get anywhere. The 30-60+ minutes it takes you to try to get even a 1/4 mile to your Hollywood accommodations from wherever you've been can be better spent (and less of it, with far fewer blood pressure spikes) driving into your tropical Palm Tree lined quiet resort. We can teach you the secrets to getting places in L.A. like the locals. For those lookin"|"We are blocks away from the 101 Freeway, which will literally lead you directly to almost any place you need to go. Although public transportation is not a hugely popular thing in Los Angeles, we are even close to the fastest public transportation in the city (the new orange line). And you have the Chauffeur option as well if you want us to do the driving. Even BETTER, though, is that L.A.'s newest high end outdoor mall, the Village, is walking distance from our front door. At the Village you'll find incredible and famous restaurants, dance studios run by Dancing with the Stars Pro's, every high end shop you could ever want and more. It's a bit of a disservice to call it a ""mall"", because it feels more like Disney and the Four Seasons partnered up to create a shopping experience."|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/cc9859dc-d89f-42f0-9668-6a7dff816243.jpg?aki_policy=large|Woodland Hills/Warner Center|Los Angeles|CA|91367|Los Angeles, CA|34.18198|-118.61103|Entire home/apt|8.0|"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Pool,Kitchen,""Free parking on premises"",Gym,""Hot tub"",""Indoor fireplace"",Heating,Washer,Dryer,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Safety card"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""24-hour check-in"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_49"",""translation missing: en.hosting_amenity_50"",""Self check-in"",""Smart lock"",Bathtub,""Game console"",""Hot water"",Microwave,""Coffee maker"",Refrigerator,Dishwasher,""Dishes and silverware"",""Cooking basics"",Oven,Stove,""BBQ grill"",""Patio or balcony"",""Beach essentials"",""Long term stays allowed"",""Well-lit path to entrance""}"|$300.00|4|95.0|Los Angeles

The neighborhood is vibrant and has an artistic movement where, if you decide to explore it, you will find various spaces full of unique expression and identity. It’s also one of the most bike friendly neighborhoods in the city (note: Mpls was ranked #1 bike city in the US 2018).|Very convenient location!

The streetcar is $1.25 per person (exact change required.) You may also purchase a day pass which is $3.00 per person all you can ride.

Blue Bikes: New Orleans has recently launched the bike share program, Blue Bikes. There are over 70 Blue Bike stations located around the city which makes riding from one area of the city to another very convenient. The bikes costs $0.13/minute and are prorated to the minute so you are only charged for riding time.|https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/3420dd05-0c93-4c0a-b7ba-5411e7c7969d.jpg?aki_policy=large|Central City / Garden District|New Orleans|LA|70130|New Orleans, LA|29.93133|-90.08477|Private room|1.0|"{TV,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Breakfast,""Free street parking"",Heating,""Smoke detector"",""Carbon monoxide detector"",""First aid kit"",""Fire extinguisher"",Essentials,Shampoo,""Lock on bedroom door"",Hangers,""Hair dryer"",""Hot water"",""Bed linens""}"|$175.00|5|96.0|New York City

And the nearby streetcar can take you anywhere else in the city you'd like to go. You’ll love  the neighborhood. My place is good for couples, solo adventurers, business travelers, and families. This is a one-bedroom unit that makes up a portion of what began as a classic Creole Cottage, but evolved into what's known locally as a shotgun double.

Later a Creole neighborhood inhabited by free people of color, the Marigny’s tangled history includes its run as an Italian Catholic stronghold in the middle of the last century, and more recently, a home to mostly progressive-minded folks drawn from all quarters of society. Artists share cafes with computer scientists, bicycle activists, and PhD candidates, next to retirees enjoying the city’s warm climate and burgeoning arts scene. From those living the hangover culture to those too cultured for a hangover, everybody’s here.|By the scale of most cities, everything would be considered walking distance; however, keep in mind it can be very hot here in summer. New Orleans recently opened a new streetcar line and it begins just a few blocks away -- just a seven-minute walk -- from your accommodations. This offers charm, but in cooler months walking offers the pleasure of the neighborhood architecture and ambience. Taxis are inexpensive compared to many cities, and they come quickly when called or requested via smartphone app (you cannot usually flag down a taxi in New Orleans; a local oddity, you have to request one).

The neighborhood, also known as “The Haight” or “Upper Haight”, succinctly personifies the City’s history, aesthetic, and culture. It is perhaps the most colorful swath of acreage in San Francisco, and remains one of the last-standing neighborhoods to retain an eccentric personality. The Haight rose to fame during the Counterculture Movement during the Vietnam War era; it became a regular feature in international news headlines and incited a global initiative for social change with special thanks to the 1967 Summer of Love, and a little help from Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead. The Haight-Ashbury neighborhood is nestled in between three parks: Golden Gate Park, the Panhandle, and Buena Vista Park, making it somewhat of an urban oasis.

The neighborhood, also known as “The Haight” or “Upper Haight”, succinctly personifies the City’s history, aesthetic, and culture. It is perhaps the most colorful swath of acreage in San Francisco, and remains one of the last-standing neighborhoods to retain an eccentric personality. The Haight rose to fame during the Counterculture Movement during the Vietnam War era; it became a regular feature in international news headlines and incited a global initiative for social change with special thanks to the 1967 Summer of Love, and a little help from Janis Joplin and the Grateful Dead. The Haight-Ashbury neighborhood is nestled in between three parks: Golden Gate Park, the Panhandle, and Buena Vista Park, making it somewhat of an urban oasis.

The Haight-Ashbury neighborhood is nestled in between three parks: Golden Gate Park, the Panhandle, and Buena Vista Park, making it somewhat of an urban oasis.

There is a community college about a mile away, so there are also some younger adults in the area as well. I commute by bike and it very easy. I do recommend riding the bus back from downtown, however. Unless if you enjoy climbing giant hills ;) Alki Beach: The beach has a great boardwalk and restaurants.  You can bike, stroll or skate on the boardwalk.  Excellent people watching! Restaurants: Duke’s is great for a bit nicer place – great seafood.  Spuds Fish and Chips is great casual food and Pegasus Pizza too. DIRECTIONS:  Turn left out of the driveway, turn left on Elmgrove, turn right on 16th, left at the 2nd light onto Austin. Stay straight through the next light sequence and turn right onto 35th. Go straight down to |Riding bikes are super easy to West Seattle or Downtown. I do recommend catching the bus back from downtown back home because of the giant hill.  To get to West Seattle take right from driveway and right on Thistle. Take right onto 34th, left onto Graham, right on 39th, and slight right onto Fauntleroy. California is the main drag so you can take a left at any point until you reach California. I recommend Brandon or Edmunds. To go downtown, ride north on 16th Ave, left on Myrtle, right on 21st. This will take you on the Neighborhood Greenway. Left on Andover, right on 22nd and then you will find a path on the right side of the sidewalk that takes you under the West Seattle Bridge. Follow signs for West Seattle Bridge Trail. Take left on East Marginal Way. This will take you to the water front. From here you can go to International District or Pioneer Square.
